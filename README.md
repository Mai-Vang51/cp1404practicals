# CP1404 Practicals

## About the repository and me

This repository contains all the practical programming exercises I have completed in my third trimester of first year.
I am a first year information technology student at James Cook University.
What I have learned about "clean code" are:

- Following the naming conventions and style guild to achieve good and unique variable names
- Avoiding "noisy" and redundant comments for functions
- Using the right tool for the right job
